      <p>
        As a kid, video games have always played a major part in my life. My
        grandparents were cool enough to buy me a Nintendo Entertainment Syetem
        when I was a kid and I've never looked back since. I can recall playing
        Super Mario Bros. for the first time and even my first experience with
        renting a Megaman game when we moved into the house that my parents
        still live in. Video games have helped me foster friendships and bonds
        with people that I grew up with and also individuals that I met and
        connected with in a multi-player lobby. I'm so thankful for my
        experiences with video games. As I've gotten older and matured, video
        games have followed suit as well. The overall delivery of animations,
        pixels, colors and especially the music from the great developers and
        programmers have always had a hold on me. The music especially.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would like to say that the first time I actually connected with a
        video game soundtrack would have to be my experience with was Donkey
        Kong Country. It was a weekend rent and I recall making it to the water
        stage (super common for water stages to have great music.) and hearing
        the first few seconds of Aquatic Ambience by David Wise. Since that
        moment my love for video game soundtracks have grown so much. I decided
        to make a personal top 10 of all the VGM tracks that I've found myself
        connected to.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope you take time and listen to these tracks with an open mind and
        enjoy what you hear.

          <b>Game Title:</b> Wild Arms 2 </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Town, Where the West Wind Blows </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2000 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Michiko Naruke </br>
            <b>Attached Memory:</b> This song reminds me alot of summers when it would just be my younger brother and I at our grandma's house. I can recall many walks to the grocery store for lunch and even he and I outside playing on the tree in the front yard. This games soundtrack really has alot of great music on it, but this one will probably be my favorite. As Ive gotten older I find myself listening to it to summon that nostalgia and think about how easy I had it.

        <h1 class="div-header">Shevat, the Wind Is Calling</h1>

        <p>
        <b>Title:</b> Shevat, The Wind Is Calling </br>
        <b>Release Year:</b> 1998 </br> 
        <b>Track Composer:</b> Yasunori Mitsuda </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> While this is an older
          game, I was lucky enough to be able to play it around 2016. I had just
          moved to the Atlanta area and recently decided to sell my Xbox. After
          a few weeks of regretting that decision, I went to a local gamestore
          and found a PS Vita for sale at a decent price. I found the game on
          the marketplace and had to have it, instantly. As I progressed through
          the game so many of Mitsuda's compositions pulled at my heart, This
          track especially. My favorite instrument in this song would probably
          be the percussion that you hear in the background. Definitely one of
          the all-time favorites for me.

        <h1 class="div-header">Zanarkand</h1>
        <br>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Final Fantasy X </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Zanarkand </br>
        <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
        <b>Track Composer:</b> Nobuo Uematsu / Masashi Hamauzu /Junyao Nakano  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> I can remember being in 9th grade and having to save the money I made for this game. I was so happy to have it when I finally was able to buy it. This was the first Final Fantasy game that I was able to beat.  The soundtrack from the very beginning kept me excited to see what the next area of the game "sounded" like.  This track in particular is the title track for Final Fantasy X. You first hear it when the game starts and the first scene runs. Alot of emotion from this track and it remains one of my favorites.

        <h1 class="div-header">Destiny, In Flux</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Soul Calibur VI </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Destiny, In Flux </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Junichi Nakatsuru  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> While this Soul Calibur VI is the most recent release for the series, this franchise has always been solid for the musical compositions that are created for this world. It is very new for me to have such a strong appreciation for music that plays in the main menu of a game, but this is definitely one of those moments. A beatiful song that gives the feeling of a long journey thats finally coming to an end.  This is definitely one that I still listen to when I'm done with a run or just hanging out by myself.

        <p>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Grandia II </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> FIGHT!!~ The Final Battle </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2000 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Noriyuki Iwadare  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> Boss battle themes have always been important to me. They're a representation of the all the struggles that the main character and the party have faced and overcome to make it to this moment that will decide the fate of the world....and in some cases the universe.  All of that is represented in this track. The beginning could be seen as the composer letting the player know how big this threat is. The midi timpani sort of eludes to the possible disastor at hand in Ryudo and his camrades don't accomplish what they need to. As the track continues the player is suddenly given the mood that "I can do this!". While it is not as dark as I often like my boss battle themes, the training/fight montage feel of this track makes it a great exception to be on this list.

        <p>
          <b>Game Title:</b> NieR: Automata </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Song of the Ancients (Atonement) </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2017 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Keiichi Okabe  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> This game quickly became one of my favorites of all time. The music played an extremely large part to my attachment to this game. Without spoiling anything, this song plays during a very cool cinematic sequence near the end of the game. As the character you control, you begin to battle, literally for your life, while getting assitance from two NPCs. While the battle is underway the camera slowly pans away into the clouds showing the player the incredible odd that these three characters must face in order to arrive at the final battle. The music laid on top of the very cool cinematic was the icing on the cake to a game that I felt couldnt get any better. I adore the entire soundtrack to this game, but this song in particular was the moment that NieR:Automata  Solidified itself as one of my favorite games of all-time.

          <b>Release Year:</b> 2017 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Yasunori Mitsuda  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> I remeber being attached to this song before owning the game. I used to anticipate seeing the commercial because this theme played during it. Everything about this song grabbed me AND it was composed by one of my favortie game composers Yasunori Mitsuda. That would be two songs by the legend that landed on this list.

          <b>Game Title:</b> Breath of Fire V  </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Electric Power Building </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2002 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Hitoshi Sakimoto </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b>  The breath of fire series is one that I wish had more entries in the series.  The music in this series has always been a draw point for me.  While this particular entry was definitely a debated favorite for some within the BOF community, the OST was still great. This song gives off an air of 'determination'. Something thats definitely present in the main character, Ryu.<br> I'm also a succer for the use of wierd noises in songs, and this one has one of my favorite.

          <b>Game Title:</b> Final Fantasy X </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Wandering Flame </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Nobuo Uematsu / Masashi Hamauzu /Junyao Nakano </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> Another song from the FFX soundtrack suprisingly( not really! ) finds its way onto my list. This song is perfect to me. I'd have a hard time describing why I love this song so much since it's a very sad sounding one. This song plays during two of my favorite cutscenes in the game, and fits them both perfectly.

      <div id="song-ten" class="song-div">
        <h1 class="div-header">Dust to Dust</h1>
        
        <p>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Final Fantasy XIII </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Dust to Dust </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Masashi Hamauzu, Mitsuto Suzuki, Ryo Yamazaki & Junya Nakano </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> This is a song from one of my favorite Final Fantasy soundtracks. The game was FF13, and it plays near the end of the game when the party realizes what must be done to save the home that they love...even though the people of that home don't love them. Another sad sounding theme that made its way into my heart. My favorite part of the song is at the 2:58 mark, when the sub bass plays with the soft synth sounds. Goosebumps, everytime. I would love for square-enix to re-release this game just to have another chance to play through this game and possibly get a second chance to appreciate everything that I didnt appreciate during my first playthrough.
