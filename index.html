<!-- Thinking about taking another direction with this page. Thinking about doing something like listing some of my favorite VGM tracks and offering and embeded video or link to the video that would let the user take a listen. -->

        As a kid, video games have always played a major part in my life. My
        granparents were cool enough to buy me a Nintendo Entertainment Syetem
        when I was a kid and I've never looked back since. I can recall playing
        Super Mario Bros. for the first time and even my first experience with
        renting Megaman when we moved into the house that my parents still live
        in. Video games have helped me foster friendships and bonds with people
        that I grew up with and also individuals that you may have met and
        connected with in a multi-player lobby. I so thankful for my experiences
        with video games. As I've gotten older and matured, video games have
        followed suit as well. The overall delivery of animations, pixels,
        colors and especially the music from the great developers and
        programmers has always had a hold on me. The music especially.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would like to say that the first time I actually connected with a
        video game soundtrack would have to be my experience with was donkey
        kong country. It was a weekend rent and I recall making it to the water
        stage (super common for water stages to have great music.) and hearing
        the first few seconds of aquatic ambience by David Wise. Since that
        moment my love for video game soundtracks have grown so much. I decided
        to make a personal top 10 of all the VGM tracks that I've found myself
        connected to.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope you take time and listen to these tracks with an open mind and
        enjoy what you hear.
