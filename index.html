    <p>
      This is a static page project that I made to talk about what I used to do
      before I became a developer.

    <p>
      My first passion is and will always be music. I loved music so much that
      at the age of 15 I had it in my mind that I would become a music producer
      of some kind. After many years of the grind I grew tired of the chase. At
      that time life started getting in the way and I decided to give it up and
      concentrate on getting my life on track. A few years later, after alot of
      hurting, feeling like a failure and healing, I've begun to feel myself
      dreaming again. I decided to share 10 of my favorite tracks that I had
      created while I was living in Georgia. I hope you take time and listen to
      these tracks with an open mind.
