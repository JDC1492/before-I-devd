      For many of us, who we are isnt just limited to one thing. As unique
      individuals we are made up ov various experiences and dreams.My first
      passion is and will always be music. I loved music so much that at the age
      of 15 I had it in my mind that I would become a music producer of some
      kind. After many years of the grind I grew tired of the chase. At that
      time life started getting in the way and I decided to give it up and
      concentrate on getting my life on track. A few years later, after alot of
      hurting, feeling like a failure and healing, I've begun to feel myself
      dreaming again. I decided to share 10 of my favorite tracks that I had
      created while I was living in Georgia. I hope you take time and listen to
      these tracks with an open mind.

          The majority of these tracks where created when I was at my lowest
          point in life. I do recall this moment in particular because I had
          recently decided to take the engineering side of music seriously. I
          realized I wanted to start creating more of my sounds rather than use
          the presets most of the time. Up until this point that is all that I
          had done. This track was the first creation after that decision.

          Age old tales is one of my favorite tracks. I recall being big in
          having a 'dark' and 'light' side to my beats. That idea isn't
          something unique, alot of my favorite producers do it all the time. I
          was always such a fan of that concept. This beat stays dark for most
          of the time. The switch wouldve given the artist a small window to
          deliver what they had written a bit differently if they decided to. I
          also was huge into recording my chants. I would use the cheap mic I
          had, record yells and hums and run them through different effect
          processors. The chants are an example of that.

          Thinking back on this moment, I can vividly recall using the chopped
          and pitched down samples as the beginning of everything. This
          particualar version of the beat is the second attempt to sample "Keep
          on Loving Me" by Devon Baldwin. My first attempt led me down a more
          pop/dance lane but I wasnt satisfied with it. I sat on it for a while
          figuring that I would get back to it at some point.<br /><br />
          After some time I decided to give it another shot. I stripped the
          percussion and tried my hand at the sample again, but was still having
          trouble. I ended up sampling a percussion loop that I time-stretched
          and piched down. After chopping it up and giving it a little rhythm
          everything else kinda flowed. The drums on this were also pretty fun
          to work on as well.

          This was a fun remix to work on. I came across the acapella of Jarrell
          Perry's "Driving Blind" and was going to give the full song a listen,
          but then I gave a thought to see if I could go into the process
          without any influences of the original. It turned out to be a remix I
          really enjoy listening to. As far as overall theme, I just wanted
          something 'big' and futuristic sounding. So I came up with what I
          thought a futuristic, sexy sounding track to accompany the acapella
          should sound like.
