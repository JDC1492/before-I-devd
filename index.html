        My first passion is and will always be music. I love music so much that
        at the age of 15 I had it in my mind that I would become a music
        producer of some kind. After many years of the grind I grew tired of the
        chase. At that time life started getting in the way and I decided to
        give it up and concentrate on getting my life on track. A few years
        later, after alot of hurting, feeling like a failure and healing, I've
        begun to feel myself dreaming again. I decided to share 10 of my
        favorite tracks that I created while I was living in Georgia. Kind of a
        way to bring together the two interests that captivate me, Code and
        Music.

        For many of us, who we are isnt just limited to one thing. As unique
        individuals, we're made up of various preferences, experiences and
        dreams. Those combination of things can all be fused and used
        creatively. For example with alot of the tracks you can hear my love for
        a rainy day in alot of the music. These tracks are a combination of all
        my likes and experiences during my time living in GA.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope you take time and listen to these tracks with an open mind and
        enjoy what you hear.
