        As a kid, video games have always played a major part in my life. My
        grandparents were cool enough to buy me a Nintendo Entertainment Syetem
        when I was a kid and I've never looked back since. I can recall playing
        Super Mario Bros. for the first time and even my first experience with
        renting a Megaman game when we moved into the house that my parents
        still live in. Video games have helped me foster friendships and bonds
        with people that I grew up with and also individuals that I met and
        connected with in a multi-player lobby. I'm so thankful for my
        experiences with video games. As I've gotten older and matured, video
        games have followed suit as well. The overall delivery of animations,
        pixels, colors and especially the music from the great developers and
        programmers have always had a hold on me. The music especially.
        <br />
        <br />
        I would like to say that the first time I actually connected with a
        video game soundtrack would have to be my experience with was Donkey
        Kong Country. It was a weekend rent and I recall making it to the water
        stage (super common for water stages to have great music.) and hearing
        the first few seconds of Aquatic Ambience by David Wise. Since that
        moment my love for video game soundtracks have grown so much. I decided
        to make a personal top 10 of all the VGM tracks that I've found myself
        connected to.
        <br />
        <br />
        I hope you take time and listen to these tracks with an open mind and
        enjoy what you hear.

        <h1 class="div-header">Town, Where the West Wind Blows</h1>
        <br>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Wild Arms 2 </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Town, Where the West Wind Blows </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2000 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Michiko Naruke </br>
            <b>Attached Memory:</b> This song reminds me alot of summers when it would just be my younger brother and I at our grandma's house. I can recall many walks to the grocery store for lunch and even he and I outside playing on the tree in the front yard. This games soundtrack really has alot of great music on it, but this one will probably be my favorite. As Ive gotten older I find myself listening to it to summon that nostalgia and think about how easy I had it.

        <h1 class="div-header">Shevat, the Wind Is Calling</h1>

        <p>
        <b>Title:</b> Shevat, The Wind Is Calling </br>
        <b>Release Year:</b> 1998 </br> 
        <b>Track Composer:</b> Yasunori Mitsuda </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> While this is an older
          game, I was lucky enough to be able to play it around 2016. I had just
          moved to the Atlanta area and recently decided to sell my Xbox. After
          a few weeks of regretting that decision, I went to a local gamestore
          and found a PS Vita for sale at a decent price. I found the game on
          the marketplace and had to have it, instantly. As I progressed through
          the game so many of Mitsuda's compositions pulled at my heart, This
          track especially. My favorite instrument in this song would probably
          be the percussion that you hear in the background. Definitely one of
          the all-time favorites for me.

        <h1 class="div-header">Zanarkand</h1>
       
        <br>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Final Fantasy X </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Zanarkand </br>
        <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
        <b>Track Composer:</b> Nobuo Uematsu / Masashi Hamauzu /Junyao Nakano  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> I can remember being in 9th grade and having to save the money I made for this game. I was so happy to have it when I finally was able to buy it. This was the first Final Fantasy game that I was able to beat.  The soundtrack from the very beginning kept me excited to see what the next area of the game "sounded" like.  This track in particular is the title track for Final Fantasy X. You first hear it when the game starts and the first scene runs. Alot of emotion from this track and it remains one of my favorites.

        <h1 class="div-header">Destiny, In Flux</h1>
        <p>
          <b>Game Title:</b> Soul Calibur VI </br>
          <b>Song Title:</b> Destiny, In Flux </br>
          <b>Release Year:</b> 2001 </br> 
          <b>Track Composer:</b> Junichi Nakatsuru  </br>
          <b>Attached Memory:</b> While this Soul Calibur VI is the most recent release for the series, this franchise has always been solid for the musical compositions that are created for this world. It is very new for me to have such a strong appreciation for music that plays in the main menu of a game, but this is definitely one of those moments. A beatiful song that gives the feeling of a long journey thats finally coming to an end.  This is definitely one that I still listen to when I'm done with a run or just hanging out by myself.
